Introduction:
I did my best to combine efficiency, organization, and simplicity in this project. 

Notes:
With that said, I did use a normal sequential search in this project instead of something more efficient to create more simplicity. There were other methods that could 
have been created in the main class, such as splitting up the while loop into different components, but this would have made the code jump to multiple different 
locations and would have gotten confusing to follow. So for simplicity sake, I cut that out during my design phase. Also, I assumed memory would be allocated to me, so 
I felt free to create arrays and lists throughout the project, though I acknowledge that is not always the case. Final note, I created a separate class object to hold 
the data of the ride in order to make the data more maintainable.

How to run:
I based this project in the console so simply click start and it will begin listing all of the information from the rides and print out the totals once it is finished.
